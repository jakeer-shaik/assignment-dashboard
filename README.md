# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Hereâ€™s a sample README file for your project:

### 3. Searching for Widgets

- Use the search bar at the top of the dashboard to filter widgets by name.
- The list of displayed widgets will update dynamically as you type.

## JSON Configuration

The dashboard's structure is defined by a JSON object that contains categories and their corresponding widgets. Below is a sample structure:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "CSPM Executive Dashboard",
      "widgets": [
        {
          "id": 101,
          "name": "Compliance Overview",
          "text": "Random text for widget content"
        },
        {
          "id": 102,
          "name": "Risk Analysis",
          "text": "Random text for widget content"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Threat Detection",
      "widgets": [
        {
          "id": 201,
          "name": "Security Alerts",
          "text": "Random text for widget content"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Modifying the JSON
You can modify the JSON structure to add new categories or widgets, or to change the names and content of existing ones. The application will render the dashboard based on this configuration.
